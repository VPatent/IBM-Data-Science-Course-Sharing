# IBM-Data-Science-Course-Sharing
A place to share notebooks with fellow learners on the IBM Data Science Courses on Coursera
In Week Four of IBM's "Python for Data Science and AI" course on Coursera, the video included an interesting example of using an API to work with basketball stats from the NBA. This intrigued me, as (years ago) I used similar data for a stats-based science fair project. I wanted to play around with the API, and I ended up pausing the video and copying out the code line by line into a Jupyter Notebook so I could see how it worked and try various tweaks. In the process, I discovered I needed to download a couple things outside of JupyterLab using my computer's terminal. (This proved to be a very simple process.) By the time I was done, I had a notebook that I thought might interest others in the class who wanted to try out the code for themselves without having to copy it line by line. So I added some markdown cells and created a repository on Github to share the notebook. If I do similar projects later in the course, I'll share those here too.
